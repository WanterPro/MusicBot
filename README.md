## What we are doing

Right now we only have one file which is the `server.js`, we are thinking about if we should make a command handler in the future.

### How to run the bot

Download the project from [GitHub](https://github.com/HanHanpy/MusicBot)

Then find the `Your Token` in the server.js file and but in your bot Token and find the `Youtube API key` if you don't have one create [here](www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqML5F8hcRQ) and you can run your bot. If you are hosting on Heroku to host your bot Heroku will give you an error because they do not support `Express` so delete from your package.json file.
